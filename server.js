/*
This is server.js, and is nominally the startup script.

It's an empty in the template, since we do not need to add any
startup script .

Where is the code that actually serves the site, you may ask?

The combination of done-serve as the running server and done-autorender
as a package lets us bypass directly serving assets, and renders views
automatically.

However, if there are things you want to do on startup on the server
side, this is the place to add those things.
