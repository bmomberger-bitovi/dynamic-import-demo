  <!-- The can-import tag loads assets, including JS, CSS (if you include the steal-css 
      plugin in package.json, as is included in this project), and LESS (with steal-less).
      
      If you are defining components with can-component, using can-import to import
      the component JS will make the component available to this template.
      
      Using the export-as="viewModel" attribute here sets the export from the app.js
      file (".js" is implied if no extension or processor is specified) as the view 
      model object for rendering this template. The value of the {{target}} magic tag below 
      (and all other values and bindings) is pulled from the view model.

  <!-- Here's can-import importing a CSS file using the steal-css plugin (it's defined
      as a plugin for StealJS in package.json).  The exclamation point at the end 
      identifies this as an asset and not a JS module.  After the exclamation point, you
      can identify the package to use to process the asset, or let StealJS choose a
      default handler based on the asset file extension (e.g. steal-css for .css files).
      
      If you look at the code output you can see the CSS has been placed on the head
      of the document in a style tag.  That's the function of steal-css.
